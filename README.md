# generative-art-esp32
This repo holds the contents needed to go from an unlit TTGO ESP-32 to something that resembles a desktop screensavers. 

## My Design Thought Process
This is my blog post for the project where I go more into depth on my specific design choices to create this wonderful piece: [post](https://dwr2118.github.io/docs/module1_docs.html)

## Boostraping
1. Make sure you have your materials: TTGO ESP32, USB-C, a laptop that can download Arduino's IDE and you can connect a USB-C into.
2. Please carefully follow the setup instructions listed in this document created by Professor Tiffany Tseng; instructor of COMS BC3930 for Fall 2024: https://coms3930.notion.site/Lab-1-TFT-Display-a53b9c10137a4d95b22d301ec6009a94
3. Download all of these Arudino files by cloning this repo on your local computer. The header files hold the arrays containing the information behind the images and sprites used in the project.
4. Ensure the .h files are in the same folder as the fall_v1.ino file. 
5. Follow the connection instructions in Prof. Tseng's documentation and you should be able to see my piece on your canvas as shown below:
